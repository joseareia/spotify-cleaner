## Why?
Spotify is notorious for creating a cache that can grow significantly over time. Sure, you can manually clear it via Spotify's app settings by pressing `Clear Cache`, but letâ€™s face it â€” Iâ€™m lazy. To address this, I created a simple Lua utility that automatically clears the cache when it exceeds 100 MB.

But why **exactly** do I care about clearing Spotifyâ€™s cache? One day, I noticed Spotify consuming an absurd amount of CPU and memory. After investigating, I discovered that the app had accumulated over 3 GB of cache. Once I cleared it and restarted Spotify, the app stopped hogging system resources.

So here we areâ€”a straightforward, automated solution for lazy people like me!

P.S.: I know Spotify allows you to set a cache limit, but whereâ€™s the fun in that when you can over-engineer a solution? ðŸ˜‰

## Dependecies

This project requires the following utilities:
1. **Lua**
The programming language used for this project. You can download and install Lua from its [official website](https://www.lua.org/download.html).

> [!TIP]
> After following the installation steps on Lua's website, don't forget to run `make install` after executing `make all test`. Additionally, consider installing [`luarocks`](http://luarocks.org), a package manager for Lua modules.

2. **Luastatic**
A command-line tool that compiles a Lua program into a standalone executable. Learn more and install it from [GitHub](https://github.com/ers35/luastatic) or via [luarocks](http://luarocks.org/modules/ers35/luastatic).

3. **Make** 
A build automation tool. If itâ€™s not already installed, you can install it on most Linux (debian-based) systems with:

```bash
sudo apt install make
```

## Installation

To install this utility, simply run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joseareia/spotify-cleaner
cd spotify-cleaner
make
make install
```

Once installed, you can safely remove the cloned repository.

> [!NOTE]
> If you wish to modify the utility (e.g., path, logic, cache size threshold), you can edit the file located at `src/main.lua`.
>
> Also, make sure the Lua interpreter version on your system matches the version used during compilation (as specified in the `Makefile`). If you're unsure, check for the Lua library in `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`. If it's missing, you can install it by running: `sudo apt install liblua5.4-dev`, or the version of your Lua interpreter.
