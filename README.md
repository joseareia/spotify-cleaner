A simple utility that cleans the Spotify cache based on a user-defined threshold. Simple, right?

## Why?
Spotify is notorious for creating a cache that can grow significantly over time. Sure, you can manually clear it via Spotify's app settings by pressing `Clear Cache`, but letâ€™s face it â€” Iâ€™m lazy. To address this, I created a simple Lua utility that automatically clears the cache when it exceeds 150 MB.

But why **exactly** do I care about clearing Spotifyâ€™s cache? One day, I noticed Spotify consuming an absurd amount of CPU and memory. After investigating, I discovered that the app had accumulated over 3 GB of cache. Once I cleared it and restarted Spotify, the app stopped hogging system resources.

So here we areâ€”a straightforward, automated solution for lazy people like me!

P.S.: I know Spotify allows you to set a cache limit, but whereâ€™s the fun in that when you can over-engineer a solution? ðŸ˜‰

## Dependecies

This project requires the following utilities:
1. **Lua**: The programming language used for this project. You can download and install Lua from its [official website](https://www.lua.org/download.html).

2. **Luastatic**: A command-line tool that compiles a Lua program into a standalone executable. Learn more and install it from [GitHub](https://github.com/ers35/luastatic) or via [luarocks](http://luarocks.org/modules/ers35/luastatic).

3. **Make**: A build automation tool. If itâ€™s not already installed, you can install it on most Linux (debian-based) systems with: `sudo apt install make`.

> [!TIP]
> By running the `configure` binary, all these dependencies will be checked, and, if needed, they will be installed for you. Even the default directory of the storage and data files of Spotify.

## Installation

To install, and therefore use this utility, first download the most [recent release](https://github.com/joseareia/spotify-cleaner/releases). Then simply run the following commands:

```console
./configure
```
This command will check every dependency that you may need in your system, and it will install everything for you. After that, just run:

```console
sudo make install
```

After the installation is completed you should have the `spotify-cleaner` usable system-wide and a new `cronjob` (that checks the cache size every five hours) created! After that, **you can safely remove the project release downloaded.**

## Additional Configurations

If you wish to modify the utility (e.g., path, cache size, etc.), you can edit the file located at `src/main.lua` and then proceed again with the installation steps.

If you desire to uninstall the utility, you can simply run:

```console
sudo make uninstall
```

This command will remove both the `spotify-cleaner` utility installed system-wide and the `cronjob` created during the installation process.
